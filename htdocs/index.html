<h2>what is it?</h2>
<p>cvsfs4hurd is a translator for the GNU Hurd, enabling to bind a (remotely
located) cvs module right into your local filesystem. It allows you to 
view version controlled files right the same way, you look at regular, locally
stored, ones.

<h2>Current release</h2>
<p>The latest version is <b>0.1</b>. This is the first release at all,
therefore please don't expect an bug-free set of programs. If you suffer
from a bug, please, please tell me.

<p>If you're used to using translators on the
Hurd you probably won't have trouble using it. As a first little
intro you may want to read this webpage, the README file and the text
cvsfs spits out, when you do this:
	<pre>    $ ./cvsfs --help</pre>

<p>In case you want some more documentation, you may want to look at the
available man page or the texinfo documentation.

<h3>Source packages</h3>
<p>The main release is C source code, which can be installed and run on
GNU Hurd systems. Get copies from berlios.de's file release system:
<a href="http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2289">here</a>.

<h3>CVS access</h3>
<p>To keep up with the development of cvsfs4hurd you can either
<a href="http://cvs.berlios.de/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/cvsfs4hurd/cvsfs/">browse latest CVS</a>
with viewcvs, 
<a href="http://developer.berlios.de/cvs/?group_id=2289">get a checkout</a>
or (if you already have cvsfs installed) 
just mount it.

<h2>Bug reports</h2>
<p>cvsfs4hurd is currently under heavy development and is far from a mature
state. Therefore, if you installed a packaged version, you probably want
to consider installing most recent CVS version first.  If the bug is in
there as well, you (might) want to either
<a href="http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?group_id=2289">file a bug report</a>
or send me an email to <a href="mailto:ssiegl@gmx.de">ssiegl@gmx.de</a>.

<h2><a name="mount">First steps</a></h2>
<p>If you've successfully compiled and installed cvsfs you probably want to
try it out. To do so, just try mounting the cvs module of xmltVR3 into
your local filesystem tree:

<ol>
<li>create a new directory acting as the underlying node of choice
    (aka mount-point)
    <pre>    $ mkdir -p cvsfs_testing</pre>
</li>

<li>start the translator
    <pre>    $ settrans -a cvsfs_testing /sbin/cvsfs cvs.sourceforge.net /cvsroot/xmltvr3 xmltVR3</pre>
</li>

<li>now use the files below the cvsfs_testing/ directory as you're used
    to, e.g. using emacs, ls, or what ever ...</li>
    
<li>to get rid of the included filesystem, just leave the cvsfs_testing/
    directory and enter
    <pre>    $ settrans -g cvsfs_testing</pre>
</li>
</ol>
