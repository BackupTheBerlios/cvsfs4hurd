  <h2>what is it?</h2>
  <p><em>cvsfs4hurd</em> is a translator for the GNU Hurd,
    enabling to bind a (remotely located) cvs module right into your
    local filesystem. It allows you to view version controlled files
    right the same way, you look at regular, locally stored, ones.
  </p>
    
  <h2>cvsfs4hurd</h2>
  <p><em>cvsfs4hurd</em> is actually the first translator I've ever written.
    It's actually one step towards the GNU Hurd for me (I haven't done much
    with it before starting to write the translator). <em>cvsfs4hurd</em>
    is not the very stable thing, lacking some more and closer testing
    as well (which I will definitely do if there is some more time on my
    side).

  <p><a href="cvsfs.html">see here</a> for more information on
    <em>cvsfs4hurd</em> (and <i>download</i> possibility).

  <h2>fuse4hurd</h2>
  <p>Short time after publishing my <em>cvsfs4hurd</em> in October 2004 I got
    more and more in touch with the <em>cvsfs</em> project for Linux
    (<a href="http://cvsfs.sourceforge.net/">http://cvsfs.sourceforge.net</a>)
    by Petric Frank.
    
  <p>Since Petric wanted to rewrite his <em>cvsfs</em> (mainly it's kernel
    part) I convinced him that using
    <a href="http://fuse.sourceforge.net">fuse</a> (a library to introduce
    userspace filesystems to Linux) is a good idea. In turn I decided to write
    a interface between Hurd's <em>netfs</em> library and fuse, which I
    call <strong>fuse4hurd</strong> - mainly to have his cvsfs available on
    the Hurd (which still has some advantages to my cvsfs implementation).
  </p>

  <p><em>fuse4hurd</em> is IMHO not ready to be released, however you might
    want to look into this projects CVS to find out some more about it :)
